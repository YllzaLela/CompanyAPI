# CompanyAPI
Company API created following the Service Repository Pattern. CRUD Functions and SQL Server Database. 
Firstly used the EF Core InMemory Data Storage method for testing only then connected it to SQL Server database.
It is completed with Repositories and Services with Interfaces for both. Used Dependency Injection methods for Inversion of Control between classes.
